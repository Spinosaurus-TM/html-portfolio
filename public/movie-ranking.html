<h1>The Best Movies According to Daood</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr \>
<h3>The Dark Knight</h3>
<p>This is my favorite movie. It has an intricate plot, aptly captures the dark Gotham vibe, something that I have a strong liking for. 
    Explores deeper philosophical concepts of Justice, Anarchy, Crime and Integrity </p> 
<h3>The Dark Knight Rises</h3>
<p>Love the character depiction. Wonderful ending</p>
<h3>Coco</h3>
<p>It touched a deeply emotional side of me as it beautifully touched upon the rather heavy concepts of life and death </p>
